# pulp-helm

A Pulp plugin to support hosting your own helm charts as (chart repository)[https://helm.sh/docs/topics/chart_repository/#helm].

If you want to host your helm charts in a OCI compliant registry, you can use the [pulp_container](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_container) plugin instead.

For more information, please see the [documentation](docs/index.rst) or the [Pulp project page](https://pulpproject.org/).

Based on the [pulp_chart](https://github.com/ananace/pulp_chart) plugin from [Alexander "Ananace" Olofsson](https://github.com/ananace).
